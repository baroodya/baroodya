- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on recreating [Birds have four legs?! NumerSense: Probing Numerical Commonsense Knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00683.pdf) with new architectures, as well as [A-Fi](https://github.com/baroodya/a-fi), a project focused on Time-series prediction and RNNS for predicting stock market prices.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Transformers, LLMs, and SOTA research in COS 484: Natural Language Processing and COS 485: Neural Networks. On my own, I'm exploring data pipelines with Apache Spark.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Neural Networks and their applications to NLP, Computer Vision, and Personal Finance, as well as ultimate frisbee, gaming computers, and the outdoors!
